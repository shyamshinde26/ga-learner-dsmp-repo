### Project Overview

 This dataset was generated using HRSC nadir panchromatic image h0905_0000 taken by the Mars Express spacecraft. The images are located in the Xanthe Terra, centered on Nanedi Vallis and covers mostly Noachian terrain on Mars. The image had a resolution of 12.5 meters/pixel.Using these images we have to determine if the instance is a crater or not a crater. 1=Crater, 0=Not Crater.


### Learnings from the project

 In this project, we learn various methods to build a model using multiple models using techniques like bagging, stacking and voting.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Python provides sci-kit learn library which helps us to use techniques like bagging, stacking and voting very easily. We have also used MinMaxScaler to scale the data.
