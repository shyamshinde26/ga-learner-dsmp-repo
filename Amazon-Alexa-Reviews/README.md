### Project Overview

 We are working in the amazon company as a data scientist. They want us to focus on customer reviews on there Alexa product. So we aim is to classify the unhappy customer based on the features 'rating', 'date', 'variation', 'verified_reviews', 'feedback'.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of how to solve sentiment analysis. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.

Train-test split
posterstemmer
Text cleaning
Random forest classifier
Metrics for classification


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 To solve this problem first we did the data cleaning part. After that we using the train test spliting we split the data into testing and training part. For prediction purpose we tried different algorithms naive Bayes, random Forest, logistic and linear svm. 


### Challenges faced

 While solving the problem we came across the class imbalanced problem which we tried to overcome using the smote.
