### Project Overview

 We have a dataset of news headlines sourced from the reputable Australian news source ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corp.) over a period of 15 years. If we dig into the keywords, you will see all the important episodes shaping the last decade and how they evolved over time. Ex: financial crisis, Iraq war, multiple US elections, ecological disasters, terrorism, famous people, Australian crimes etc. A much better way to comprehend these topics would be using topic modelling to find out relevant topics within a particular time frame.

The main goal of this problem is to leverage the power of techniques like LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to assign topics to unseen news headlines.


### Learnings from the project

 Text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, POS tagging etc.
Enhance your data visualization skills
Topic modelling with LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
Use coherence score to determine the optimum number of topics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 first of all, we tried to remove the stop words then using tokenization we tokenized the words. at the end, we used the LSA and LDA for the topic modelling. 


### Challenges faced

 In this project, we learned to solve the topic modelling problem using NLP techniques like LSA and LDA. Along with this, we also applied data cleaning techniques like tokenization to get that data in a proper format.
