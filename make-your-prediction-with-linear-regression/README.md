### Project Overview

 
You are a die hard Lego enthusiast wishing to collect as many board sets as you can. But before that you wish to be able to predict the price of a new lego product before its price is revealed so that you can budget it from your revenue.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have the better understanding of how to build a linear regression model. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.

Train-test split
Correlation between the features
Linear Regression
MSE and R^2 Evaluation Metrics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this concept, we have used a linear regression model to predict the target variable.  Python provides a library named as sklearn which provides us with a linear regression function for the prediction.
