### Project Overview

 A company wants to know the reason why the claim was not made. Doing so would allow the insurance companies to improve their policy for giving a loan to the customer. In this project we are dealing with various features such as age, occupation, etc. based on that let's get back to the final conclusion.


### Learnings from the project

 This is the imbalanced dataset. Here 0 - Claim was not made, 1 - Claim made. After completing this project, we will have a better understanding of how to deal with the imbalanced dataset. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.

Train-test split
Standard scaler
Logistic Regression
SMOTE
feature scaling


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this project, we try different techniques to solve the problem of class imbalance. We have used smote to solve this problem. Along with this, we have encoded the categorical data with label encoder.
