### Project Overview

 Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers.Telephone service companies, Internet service providers, pay TV companies, insurance firms, and alarm monitoring services, often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of their key business metrics because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.

Predictive analytics use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing customer retention marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of how to build a boosting model. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.

Handling missing values in data
Applying AdaBoost
Applying XGBoost
Interpreting evaluation metrics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 As we know python provides a wide range of libraries which helps us to implement very complicated things like boosting easily. To solve this problem we have taken the sklearn library from that we take ensemble techniques we can import various boosting techniques.


### Challenges faced

 we also performed data cleaning in this project. Using the pandas library of python we can easily do the data manipulation techniques.
