### Project Overview

 in this project, we are using a dataset has details of 6830 house entries with 16 features. This a housing problem which we have solved using a concept called as regularization.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of how to build a regularized regression model. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.

Train-test split

Correlation between the features

Linear Regression

Polynomial Regressor

Lasso Regressor

Ridge Regressor

R^2 Evaluation Metrics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 To solve this project we are using a python programming language which provides us with various inbuilt methods to solve this problem. We have used cross-validation, Lasso, ridge functions to solve the housing problem.
