Chi Square Test


### Learnings from the project

 Confidence Interval

Central Limit Theorem

Hypothesis Testing

Chi Square Test


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Python provides many libraries like scipy to find the values like chi sqaured values, z critical values, t test values etc. python provides direct methods o solve these problems.
