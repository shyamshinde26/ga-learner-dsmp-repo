### Project Overview

 Google Play Store serves as the official app store for the Android operating system, allowing users to browse and download applications. The success of an app is largely determined by its ratings. Conduct an EDA on the Google Play Store data and try to explore whether, given the data, ratings of an app can be predicted


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of certain methods of EDA and Data Preprocessing. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.
Outlier detection and treatment

Detection and Handling of missing values

Reducing skewness of data

standardizing and normalizing continuous variable

Encoding categorical data


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 To solve this project we will be using visualization methods like boxplot, scatter plot, histplot, regplot, etc. Other then visualization we will be using many pandas and sklearn methods for detection and treatment of outliers and missing data such as dropna, fillna, get_dummies, etc.


### Challenges faced

 This is a very crucial thing in machine learning because if our data is incorrect form our model won't be able to perform correctly and the end result will be very poor. We need to understand concepts like where to use label encoder and where to use a one-hot encoder. Along with this, removing skewness is also a very important part. Identifying the type of skewness and to remove it which method we should use is challenging in such a task.
