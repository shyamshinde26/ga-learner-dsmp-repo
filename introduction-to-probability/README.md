### Project Overview

 For this project, we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of probability. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.

Independency check
Bayes theorem
Visualizing discrete variable
Visualizing continuous variable


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 To solve this project,  I have used various probability concepts like conditional probability, set theory, Bayes theorem. Along with this some distribution concepts like normal distribution, binomial distribution, standard normal distribution.


### Challenges faced

 In this, I have faced many challenges like how to implement Bayes theorem on a dataset how to calculate p-value and z-score using z-table.
