### Project Overview

 For this project, we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back.
Using the Decision Tree model, classify whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, we will have a better understanding of how to build a decision tree model. In this project, we will apply the following concepts.

Train-test split
Correlation between the features
Decision Tree Modeling
Evaluation Metrics
Graphviz plotting


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 To solve this, we have used the decision tree algorithm and to compare the results we have used gridsearchcv. Also we have use sci-kit learn, pandas, pydotplus these kinds of tools.
