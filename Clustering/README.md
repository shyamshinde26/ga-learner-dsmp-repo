### Project Overview

 Customer segmentation lies at the heart of every consumer-facing business nowadays which involves being able to identify different types of customers and then figuring out ways to find more of those individuals so we canâ€¦ we guessed it, get more customers!
In this project, we'll be doing exactly that, albeit with the help of K-Means clustering and observe how we can form groups of customers exhibiting similar behavior.


### Learnings from the project

 Successfully solving this project will help us apply the following skills:

Data Manipulation
Dimensionality Reduction Technique with PCA
KMeans clustering
Interpreting clusters with visualization


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In the K-means algorithm, it is very difficult to decide the value of K. So we can get the correct value of K by elbow method. We first calculate the K and then we give the insights for the dataset.
