### Project Overview

 The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.


### Learnings from the project

 We will learn to explore data insights in depth.
We will learn to implement Support Vector Machines
We will learn to perform feature selection with the help of Support Vector Machines
We will learn to find the best suitable hyperparameters with the help of grid search providing a better understanding of the usage of hyperparameter tuning.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 In this project, we have used support vector machines for prediction of our result. Along with that, to find the best parameters to get the best result we have used GridsearchCV.
